## Generating prompts

When I ask for generating prompt, save it in the md format in the folder .amazonq/prompts. 
Ask for the file name, if not provided.

My approach in crating web site is to implement one feature at once. Step by step.
I don't know Hugo, Tailwind and Daisy, so my goals are:

- create a working website
- get familiar with the technology stack; understand the whole code and be able to modify it when needed
- adjust requirement during the implementation; they can be totally changed.

Split the whole project to small steps. Each step should contains a useful piece of  code, which, after completion,
can be deployed. It can be split to a smaller steps, which not necessarily can be deployed alone on prod.

I want to start from developing really basic site and deploy it on prod asap. Then, I'm going to add
new features, step by step. Provide the best approach for that. Create plan of actions with checklists.
Assess the time required for each step with explanation.

Each step should contains prerequisites, for instance
- what should be installed locally
- which account should be created (like github, cloud flare account, domain connected with the cloud flare hosting etc)
- required configuration (like token to api)
- required and recommended knowledge (with the detailed/narrowed list of features, not general like knowing Hugo)

It should also contains info which actions should be triggered. For instance
- update the documentation for admin
- what should be tested and how

everything in the requirements are suggestions. Feel free to change it or add something different or complementary.
Be creative.

If I made and error in requirements, for instance writing about something that doesn't make sense, please correct me.
I'm going to learn and I need feedback. Lots of it. You can use the tone of the stand-up performer. I won't be offended.

If you have a shade of uncertainty, ask me providing the options, comparison and suggestions which is recommended.
