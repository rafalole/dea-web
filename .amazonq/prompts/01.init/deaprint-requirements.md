# Requirements for the Deaprint website

## Technology Stack Requirements

- Hugo
- Tailwind and Daisy UI

## Site structure

Suggested types of pages (but not limited to these):

* Home
* About
* Portfolio
* Services / Pricing - see deaprint-services-prices.md
* Contact with contact form, info about parking, etc., location on Google Maps
* Blog / Articles
* Gallery categories (based on the products and services, suggest something else)
* FAQ
* Advice, e.g., how to dress for a photo session, about makeup, hairstyle, etc. It can be a blog article pinned to the menu entry (propose the best solution)
* Display comments from Google
* Display comments from Facebook
* Integrate Google Business Profile

Add any extras.

Use as many Hugo features as possible and reasonable/useful.

## Business Requirements

### Multilingual

The service is in languages:

- Polish (default)
- English
- Ukrainian - use UK
- optionally others in the future

If i18n is used, it should be switched automatically when the language is changed.

Use folder structure:

- content/
  - pl/ (default)
  - en/
  - uk/

### Content Management

All text should be in *.md (markdown files) with frontmatter.
By default, content will be created in Polish language.
If there is text hardcoded in the template (it should be avoided), use i18n.

### Info Messages

It's possible to display messages.
Kinds of messages:

- warning - examples:
  - the studio will be closed because of a holiday
  - the deadline for calendars to be done before Christmas
- info
  - promotions on calendars

- User can accept the message and then the message should disappear (be hidden)
- The period when the message is visible should be configurable in frontmatter
- It's possible to display more than one message at the same time (overlap in time)

### Translation

Use hybrid translation approach:

- Automatic translation on commit (CI/CD) using OpenRouter + LLM (preferred) for draft translation
  - Alternative options: Google Translate API, DeepL API
  - Suggest which LLM model to use (e.g., GPT-4, Claude, etc.)
- Manual QA using AI via OpenRouter

### Theme

Build a fully custom Hugo theme using Daisy UI + Tailwind

## Image Handling Strategy

✔️ Use Hugo Pipes for optional image optimization
✔️ Use /assets for source images
✔️ Use /static for faster static file passthrough
✔️ Use figure, custom shortcodes, and gallery layouts generated by AI

Optional:

* Automatic gallery generation from folders
* EXIF extraction (Hugo supports this)
* Lazy loading (Hugo + Daisy UI supports this well)

## Automation Expectations

✔️ Layout generation
✔️ Daisy UI/Tailwind templates
✔️ Multilingual config
✔️ Front matter generators
✔️ Gallery indexers
✔️ SEO metadata
✔️ Analytics
✔️ CI/CD

### Working Style 

Provide:

* A super-prompt
* A sequence of small prompts for Amazon Q workflow
* Manual workflow equivalent

## Regulatory Requirements

Support for cookies (analytics, session management, etc.).
Inform the user that cookies are used.
User can accept or not accept - the application should work accordingly.
Information about personal data management and privacy policy - generate a separate page for that.
Fill it with recommended content.
Suggest what more should be done to comply with regulations.

## Assets

The company logo (with name) is in file: /home/devlin/Pictures/Dea/logoDeaPrint.jpg
The logo without name is in file: /home/devlin/Pictures/Dea/logoDeaPrint_noText_C.jpg
It will be replaced with PNG or SVG version.

## Hosting

Hosting Recommendation — Cheap + SSL + Automation
Recommended: free tier with Cloudflare Pages
Alternative options: Netlify, Vercel (provide comparison if suggesting alternatives)

## Content Management

The only required modification for updating content (text, blog, price, products, etc.) is to modify the relevant md file.
The workflow should start immediately after check-in.

### Git Workflow

Use GitHub Actions for building. Add info about which steps can be replaced by Cloudflare Pages and required changes to the configuration.
Include translations as described in the Translation section above.

Branches:

- **main** - after merge/update, automatically deploys to production. Uses content prepared in preprod; no additional actions should be done (like translation, generating thumbnails, etc.)
- **preprod** - after updating/merging to this branch, triggers full build and deployment to staging environment
  - Propose the URL for the staging website
  - Includes: translation using AI via OpenRouter, preparing photos and other assets, and cleanup of sources (like minifying CSS)
  - List all build steps and actions
- **develop** - used for development of new features. Used for local development. Can be deployed to dev environment to check new features. This branch can be synchronized with prod (rebase) and merged with feature branches (if deployment to dev environment is needed)
- **feature branches** - individual feature development

### Workflow for New Features

New features can be requested by user or developer.
Propose workflow for: developer → admin → content creator → user
Consider using GitHub Issues for tracking.

## Communication Channel

In case of errors in the build process, create a GitHub issue and notify users.
Provide tips on how to configure it and which channel of notification to use (email, WhatsApp, Slack, Discord, etc.).

## Admin Panel

Use Sveltia CMS for editing markdown files.
Add info about changes required if I'd like to use:

- Decap CMS
- Custom Solution with GitHub API

Admin panel should be accessible from all branches.
There should be an option to merge from develop to main via the admin panel.

## Testing

I'd like to use a test-driven approach, if it's possible and wise in this case. Analyze it and give me recommendations.
Describe if and how to implement unit tests.

Describe acceptance test scenarios for each phase, with checklists.
Explain/suggest workflow for testing.

Suggest other good practices in terms of tests.

Generate documentation about test workflow (when it is established/defined).

## Documentation

All documentation should be generated into the /docs folder.

I can see these roles in the project:
- developer
- designer/UX designer
- system administrator - technical infrastructure, hosting, security
- site manager - day-to-day operations, user management, monitoring
- content creator
- editor/content manager
- marketing manager
- product owner

Describe the roles, responsibilities, and scopes.
Add separate documentation for each role. Some suggestions are below.
It's a small project, so maybe it's not necessary. Suggest an optimal solution.

### Developer Documentation

Documentation for the developer should be embedded into the source files. It should contain, among others:
- the responsibilities of the class/file
- the purpose of the method/block of code
- other good practices for such cases - generate what it should contain

General dev documentation should be generated to the /docs/dev folder.
Generate what it should contain.

### Admin Documentation

Document workflows, their configuration, accessing, deployment process, configuration, monitoring, etc.
Suggest what should be documented.
Put it in the /docs/admin folder.

Document the actions which should be taken in case of common errors.

### Content Creator Documentation

It should contain information:
- how to create/modify content
- what to do in case of issues
- how workflow works and how to execute/test subsequent steps
- good practices in creation of content
- how to prepare assets
- how to add/modify all kinds of information in md files
- what's possible to implement, with examples in the content of the page
- how to stage, commit, and rollback changes using non-technical language
- other - suggest what should be documented

Proposed location of these documents is /docs/content (can be changed if recommended).

### Analytics Documentation

Explain:
- how to configure and use analytics
- what was done for SEO
- how to check the effectiveness and improve SEO

What I've written may not make sense - propose a proper approach to SEO and analytics.

### User Documentation

Explain to users:
- how workflow works
- how to request changes
- generate what should be there

Create a checklist of what should be checked (and how) after new deployment:
- of a whole site, with changes done by developer
- with a new/modified CI/CD process
- after adding/modifying content

Notify user about it; create a task for them with checklist.
If there is a better option, propose it and describe/compare.

### Issues

Issues can be reported by every role in the project (developer, admin, content creator, user),
and addressed to any other role.
Instruct the user on how to report issues to GitHub Issues. Maybe it's worth adding an option to the admin panel?
Describe the issue workflow and possible configuration from the user's point of view.
The configuration will be done by admin - user has to know how the interaction looks and what they should provide
(like email, WhatsApp, Slack, Discord, etc.).
The description should also be visible in the admin panel. User shouldn't be forced to log into GitHub.

## Optional Features

### Workflow for Customer to Send Photo

If customer orders a digital version of the asset, it will be sent to the email. Propose workflow for that.
My proposal:

1. Client selects the option like: request for digital asset
2. Client fills the form with their name and email address, optionally with phone number
3. The email is sent to the deaprint email, with copy to the user
4. The content of the email contains a link to modify booking (including cancelling)
5. After creating the asset, photographer can reply to that email or click the link and send the asset
6. Optionally, the asset can be on the server, and only a link can be sent (customer can choose what they prefer)

Add protection against spammers and too many sent messages from the same person (possible solutions: rate limiting, CAPTCHA, etc.).

### Generation of Content

In admin panel, add options to generate and add different content using AI:
- user describes what they need (e.g., a blog entry about photobooks, info about holiday, promotions)
- app sends prompt to AI (OpenRouter) asking for good prompts
- user can modify and reject/accept
- accepted prompt is sent to AI. The response is placed in the destination (md file, maybe assets like photos)
- user can accept it by checking into the repo or rollback
- save (check in or stage) changes before asking AI for modification
