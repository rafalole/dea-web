# Requirements for the Deaprint website

## Technology Stack Requirements

- Hugo
- Tailwind and Daisy UI

## Site structure

Suggested types of pages (but not limited)

* Home
* About
* Portfolio
* Services / Pricing - see deaprint-services-prices.md
* Contact with contact form, info about parking etc, location on Google maps;
* Blog / Articles
* Gallery categories (based on the products and services, suggest something else)
* FAQ
* Advices, e.g. how to dress for the photo, about the make-up, hairdo etc. It can be a blog article pin to the menu entry (propose the best solution)
* Display comments from Google
* Display comments from Facebook
* Integrate Google business profile

Add any extras.

Use as many Hugo features as possible and reasonable/useful.

## Business Requirements

### Multilingual

The service is in languages:

- polish (default)
- english
- ukrainian - use UK
- optionally others in the future

if i18n is used, it should be switched automatically when the language is changed.

Use folder structure:

- content/
  - pl/ (default)
  - en/
  - uk/

### Content Management

All text should be in *.md (markdown files) with frontmatter.
By default, content will be created in polish language.
If there is a text hardcoded in the template (it should be avoided), use i18n

### Info

It's possible to display a message.
Kinds of message

- warning - example:
  - the studio will be closed because of holiday
  - the deadline for calendars to be done before Christmas
- info
  - promotions on calendars

- User can accept the message and then the message should disappeared (be hidden)
- The period when the message is visible should be configurable (in frontmatter?)
- It's possible to display more than one message at the same time (overlap in time)

### Translation

Use hybrid translation (Best for workflow automation)

- Automatic translation on commit (CI/CD); use API for draft translation
- Manual QA using AI (openrouter)

### Theme

Build a fully custom Hugo theme using Daisy UI + Tailwind

## Image Handling Strategy

✔️ Use Hugo Pipes for optional image optimization
✔️ Use /assets for source images
✔️ Use /static for faster static file passthrough
✔️ Use figure, custom shortcodes, and gallery layouts generated by AI

Optional:

* Automatic gallery generation from folders
* EXIF extraction (Hugo supports this)
* Lazy loading (Hugo + Daisy UI supports this well)

## Automation Expectations

✔️ Layout generation
✔️ Daisy UI/Tailwind templates
✔️ Multilingual config
✔️ Front matter generators
✔️ Gallery indexers
✔️ SEO metadata
✔️ Analytics
✔️ CI/CD

### 6. Working Style 

Provide:

* A super-prompt
* A sequence of small prompts for Amazon-Q workflow
* Manual workflow equivalent

## Regulatory requirements

Support for cookies, if used. 
Inform user that cookies are used.
User can accept of not accept - the application should work accordingly
information about personal data management and privacy policy - generate separate page for that. 
Fill it with recommended content. 
Suggest what more should be done to be comply with the regulatory.

## Assets

The company logo (with name) is in file: /home/devlin/Pictures/Dea/logoDeaPrint.jpg
The logo without name is in file: /home/devlin/Pictures/Dea/logoDeaPrint_noText_C.jpg
It will be replaced with png or svg version

## Hosting

Hosting Recommendation — Cheap + SSL + Automation
recommended: free tier with Cloud Flare pages

## Content management

The only required modification in case of updating content (text, blog, price, products etc) is to modify md file
The workflow should start immediately after check-in

### Git workflow

Use github actions for building. Add info which step can be replaced by cloud flare pages and required changes to the configuration.
Include translations described earlier.

Branches

- main - after merge/update it should automatically deploy to the final destination. It should use content prepared in the draft, 
  no additional actions should be done (like translation, generating thumbnails etc.) 
- preprod - after updating/ merging to this branch, the whole building and deploying process to the draft webpage should be deployed. 
  - Propose the url for the dev (draft) website.  
  It should contains translation using AI via openrouter, preparing photos and other asssets, and clean up sources (like minify css) 
    - list them and the actions.
- develop - it can be used for a development of new features of the website. It will be used for the local development. 
  It can be deployed to dev env to check new features. This branch can be synchronized with prod (rebase) and merged with features
  (if deployment to dev env is needed)
- features - feature branch

### Workflow for the new features

The new feature can be requested by user or developer
Propose workflow for developer - admin - content creator - user. Maybe using Github issues? 

## Communication Channel

In case of errors in build process, create the Github issue and notify users.
Provide tips how to configure it and which chanel of notification to use.

## Admin Panel

Use Sveltia CMS for editing markdown file.
Add info about changes required when I'd like to use

- Decap CMS
- Custom Solution with GitHub API

Admin panel should be in develop branch.
There should be an extra option to merge from develop to main

## Test

I'd like to use test driven approach, if it's possible and wise in this case. Analyse it and give me recommendations.
Describe if and how implement unit tests

Describe acceptance test scenario for each phase, with the checklists
Explain/ suggest workflow for testing.

Suggests other good practice in the terms of tests.

Generate documentation about test workflow (when it is established/ defined).

## Documentation

All documentation should be generated into the folder /docs

I can see those roles in the project
- developer
- designer/ UX designer
- system administrator - technical infrastructure, hosting, security
- site manager - day-to-day operations, user management, monitoring
- content creator
- editor/ content manager
- marketing manager
- product owner

Describe the roles, responsibilities, scopes.
Add separate documentation for each role. Some suggestions are below.
It's a small project, so maybe it's not necessary. Suggest optimal solution.

### Developer Documentation

Documentation for the developer should be embedded into the source file. It should contains, among others
- the responsibility of the class/file
- the purpose of the method/ block of code
- other good practices for such cases - generate what it should be.

General dev documentation should be generated to the folder /docs/dev
Generate what it should contains.

### Admin Documentation

Document workflows, its configuration, accessing, deployment process, configuration, monitoring etc.
Suggest what should be documented.
Put it in the folder /docs/admin

Document the actions which should be taken in case of the common errors.

### Content Creator documentation

It should contains information
- how to create/modify content,
- what to do in case of issues
- how workflow works and how execute/test subsequent steps
- good practices in creation of the content
- how to prepare assets
- how to add/modify all kind of information in md files
- what's possible to implement, with examples in the content of the page
- how to stage, commit and rollback changes using non-technical language
- another - suggest what should be documented.
Proposed location of this documents is /docs/content (can be changed if recommended)

### Analytics Documentation

Explain
- how to configure and use analytics
- what was done for seo
- how to check the effectiveness and improve seo

It may not have sense what I've written - propose a proper approach to seo and analytics.

### User Documentation

Explain users
- how workflow works
- how to request changes
- generate what should be there

Create a checklist what should be checked (and how) after new deployment
- of a whole site, with changes done by developer
- with a new/ modified CI/CD process
- after adding/modifying content

Notify user about it; create a task for him with checklist.
If there is better option, propose it and describe/compare.

### Issues

Issues can be reported by every role in the project (developer, admin, content creator, user), 
and addressed to any other role.
Instruct user how to report issues to github issues. Maybe it's worth to add option to the admin panel?
Describe the issue workflow and possible configuration from the user point of view. 
The configuration will be done by admin - user has to know how the interaction looks and what they should provide
(like email, whatsApp, slack, discord etc)
The description should be also visible in the admin panel. User shouldn't be forced to log into github

## Optional Features

### Workflow for Customer to send Photo

If customer order digital version of the asset, it will be sent to the email. Propose workflow for that.
My proposition:

1. Client select the option like: request for digital asset
2. Client fill the form with they name and email address, optionally with phone nbr
3. The mail is sent to the deaprint email, with copy to the user
4. The content of the mail contains link to modify booking (including cancelling) 
5. After creating the asset, photograph can reply to that email or click the link and sent the asset
6. Optionally, the asset can be on the server, and only link can be sent (customer can choose what they prefer)

Add protection against spammers and too many sent messages from the same person. (possible solutions)

### Generation of the content

In admin panel, add options to generate and add different contents using AI
- user describes what they need (e.g. a blog entry about photobooks, info about holiday, promotions)
- app send prompt to AI (openrouter) asking for a good prompts
- user can it modify and reject/accept
- accepted prompt is send to AI. The respnse is placed in the destination (mf file, maybe assets like photos)
- user can accept it by checkin to the repo or rollback
- save (checkin or stage) changes before asking AI for modification
