Hi, I'm Kasia!

I've been taking photos for years, and honestly? I love what I do.

Most of the time, you'll find me shooting document photos—passports, IDs, visa photos—all the official stuff that needs to be just right. But I also do portfolio shoots and personal sessions when inspiration strikes.

My secret weapon? Patience. Lots of it. Kids, toddlers, even babies who'd rather do anything but sit still—I've got you covered. We'll get that perfect shot, even if it takes a few tries (or a few silly faces).

Don't just take my word for it—check out my 5.0-star Google reviews. Happy clients are what keep me going.

Oh, and one more thing: I always have candy on hand. You know, for emergencies. 🍬

Let's capture your moment!
