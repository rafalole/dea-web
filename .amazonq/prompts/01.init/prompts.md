## Generating Prompts

When I ask to generate a prompt, save it in markdown format in `.amazonq/prompts/` organized in subfolders by topic.
Ask for the filename if not provided.

My approach to creating a website is to implement one feature at a time, step by step.
I don't know Hugo, Tailwind, or Daisy UI, so my goals are:

- Create a working website
- Understand the technology stack well enough to modify code independently when needed
- Remain flexible with requirements during implementation; they can pivot completely if needed

Split the project into small steps. Each step should contain a useful piece of code that produces a production-ready,
deployable result. Steps can be divided into smaller substeps that show progress but don't need individual production deployment.

I want to start by developing a really basic site and deploying it to production ASAP. Then, I'll add
new features step by step. Provide the best approach for this. Create an action plan with checklists.
Assess the time required for each step in hours/days of work with explanation.

Each step should contain prerequisites, for instance:
- What should be installed locally
- Which accounts should be created (like GitHub, Cloudflare account, domain connected with hosting, etc.)
- Required configuration (like API tokens)
- Required and recommended knowledge (with detailed, specific feature lists—not general statements like "knowing Hugo")

It should also contain info about which actions should be triggered, for instance:
- Update the documentation for admin
- What should be tested and how

Everything in the requirements is a suggestion. Feel free to change it, add something different, or propose complementary approaches.
Be creative. I'm open to alternatives in the technology stack if they better suit the goals.

If I made an error in requirements—for instance, writing about something that doesn't make sense—please correct me.
I'm here to learn and I need feedback. Lots of it. Feel free to be direct, humorous, and honest. I won't be offended.

When in doubt, ask me by providing options, comparisons, and recommendations for which approach is best.
