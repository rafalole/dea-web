I need a webpage for the company DeaPrint.

The content should be in md files.
The technology stack: Hugo + Tailwind CSS + Daisy UI

Use github to store source code and to deploy generated web site.
Project is already in github: https://github.com/rafalole/dea-web/

Save prompt in [deaprint-description.md](01.init/deaprint-description.md)

Generate prompt which will ask for that. Be creative - the specification is just a guideline. 
Add web site features typical for that type of company activities
